simple rent calculator

The project is a web-based "Rent Calculator" designed to simplify the process of splitting rent among multiple individuals sharing a living space. Users can input the total rent amount and the number of people sharing it. The calculator then divides the rent equally among the individuals and displays the calculated amount for each person.

Additionally, the calculator allows users to account for any extra spending by individuals. It provides an option to enter additional spend amounts for each person, which adjusts their respective rent shares accordingly.

The interface is user-friendly, featuring input fields for rent amount and number of persons, along with a submit button to trigger the calculation. It also includes interactive buttons to facilitate entering additional spend amounts for individual users.

Behind the scenes, the calculator utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive user experience. JavaScript handles the logic for rent calculation, dynamic HTML generation, and managing the popup window for entering extra spend amounts.

Overall, the Rent Calculator project aims to streamline the process of rent division and expense tracking for shared living arrangements. It provides a convenient tool for users to fairly split rent among housemates or roommates, promoting transparency and efficiency in shared financial responsibilities.
